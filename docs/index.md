## Use & Respecting Level Designers
**Please do not use `bsp_tool` to copy or steal another creator's work**  
The primary goal of `bsp_tool` is to extend community mapping tools  

Always ask the mappers permission before using their work!
And credit the original mapper!
Don't stop at copying existing maps!
Show us all what level design tools can do in the hands of players!
