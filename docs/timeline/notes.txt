Sabre 3D, Unreal & Tim Willits will come up if we talk about Quake Champions

Id Tech 6 / Sabre3D hybrid [FORK]

Explaining that is way off scope

Doom / IdTech 1 -> Quake / Quake II / Half-Life / IdTech 2 -> IdTech Lineage
GoldSrc -> Source Engine -> Respawn's Source Engine Fork / Source 2
(Can discuss engine limitations via Apex Legends & CS-GO:DangerZone level design
QuakeWorld -> Call of Duty Series [citation needed]


format relationships
 .ase files can pass ascii models from Id Tech/IW Engine .map files to UDK (Unreal Development Kit)
 .map (Id Tech) -> .rmf (GoldSrc) -> .vmf (Source Engine)
 ^ all 3 can be compiled into .bsp for their respective engines

 Garry's Mod / S&box shall consume all
