THis can get complicated fast
need to set a limit on what is relevant
making a wiki rabbithole mapper here

not everything needs a write up, should have a bare skeleton with optional deeper dives

Sabre 3D, Unreal & Tim Willits will come up if we talk about Quake Champions
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_Champions
Id Tech 6 / Sabre3D hybrid [FORK]
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saber_Interactive
Sabre built their own engine (sabre 3d) and made a UE4 hybrid in the Halo MCC
Explaining that is way off scope

Doom / IdTech 1 -> Quake / Quake II / Half-Life / IdTech 2 -> IdTech Lineage
GoldSrc -> Source Engine -> Respawn's Source Engine Fork / Source 2
(Can discuss engine limitations via Apex Legends & CS-GO:DangerZone level design
QuakeWsrs -> Call of Duty Series


formar relationships
 .ase files can pass ascii models from Id Tech/IW Engine .map files to UDK (Unreal Development Kit)
 .map (Id Tech) -> .rmf (GoldSrc) -> .vmf (Source Engine)
 ^ all 3 can be compiled into .bsp for their respective engines
 and then there's .wad
 Garry's Mod / S&box shall consume all
